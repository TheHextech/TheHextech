### Hi there 👋🏻🤠

I’m here to share my learning journey! 

Here you can find all my personal projects and projects that I realized for the courses I studied. My goal is to edit these contents in a well documented and explanatory way, with the hope that anyone can consult my repositories and find them useful!  

- 🌱 I'm currently studying Machine Learning for Data Science
- 🔧 I want to skill note-taking and knowledge management with Obsidian and learning techniques for my personal growth
- 🤝🏻 I'd like to realize collaborations for Data Science and Python scripting projects
